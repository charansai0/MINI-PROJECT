# IMAGE STEGANOGRAPHY 
## INTODUCTION:
Steganography is the art and science of invisible communication. This is an accomplished through hiding information in other information, thus hiding the existence of the communicated information. the word steganography is derived from the Greek words “stego” meaning “cover” and “grafia” meaning “writing” defined it as “covered writing”. In image steganography the information is hidden exclusively in images.

### EXISTING SYSTEM
In special domain, the hiding process such as least significant bit replacement is done LSB method has intense effect on the statistical information of image like histogram attackers could be aware of a hidden communication.

### PROPOSED SYSTEM
This system overcomes the  demerits  of using single  level of hiding. That is either using steganography.

•	In our system we are not following the regular encryption, decryption techniques.

•	This encryption is embedded into a image.

•	Again it will be embedded into another media. This double embedding increases	the level of security.

### USE CASE DIAGRAM

A use case diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of behavioral diagram defined by and created from a Use-case analysis. Its purpose is to present a graphical overview of the functionality provided by a system in terms of actors, their goals (represented as use cases), and any dependencies between those use cases. The main purpose of a use case diagram is to show what system functions are performed for which actor. Roles of the actors in the system can be depicted.

### ACTIVITY DIAGRAM

Activity diagrams are graphical representations of workflows of stepwise activities and actions with support for choice, iteration and concurrency. In the Unified Modeling Language, activity diagrams can be used to describe the business and operational step-by-step workflows of components in a system. An activity diagram shows the overall flow of control.

### SEQUENCE DIAGRAM

A sequence diagram in Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a kind of interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order. It is a construct of a Message Sequence Chart. Sequence diagrams are sometimes called event diagrams, event scenarios, and timing diagrams.

### Class Diagram

In the software Engineering, a class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language(UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes , operations( or Methods), and the relationships among the classes. It explains which class contains information.

### Data Flow Diagram
The DFD is also called as bubble chart. It is a simple graphical formalism that can be used to represent a system in terms of the input data to the system, various processing carried out on these data, and the output data is generated by the system.
